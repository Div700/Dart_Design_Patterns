# Bridge Design Pattern

## Overview

The **Bridge** is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. Instead of a permanent binding between abstraction and implementation, the Bridge pattern provides a bridge interface that makes the functionality of concrete classes independent from interface implementer classes.

## Intent

- Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so both can vary independently
- Avoid permanent binding between abstraction and implementation
- Share implementation among multiple objects and hide implementation details from clients
- Switch implementations at runtime
- Extend abstractions and implementations independently

## Problem Solved

When you have hierarchies that need to grow in multiple dimensions, inheritance creates an explosion of classes:

1. **Class Explosion** - N abstractions × M implementations = N×M classes
2. **Tight Coupling** - Changes in implementation affect abstraction hierarchy  
3. **Runtime Switching** - Cannot change implementation after object creation
4. **Code Duplication** - Similar abstractions repeated for each implementation

## Implementation: AI Task Processing System

This implementation demonstrates the Bridge pattern using AI task processing where different types of tasks (abstractions) can work with different AI models (implementations).

### Structure

```
AITask (Abstraction)
├── model : AIModel
├── constructor(AIModel)
└── run(input) : Future<String>

Refined Abstractions:
├── QuestionAnsweringTask
│   └── run(input) : Future<String>
├── SummarizationTask  
│   └── run(input) : Future<String>
└── CodeGenerationTask
    └── run(input) : Future<String>

AIModel (Implementation Interface)
└── generateResponse(prompt) : Future<String>

Concrete Implementations:
├── GPT4Model
│   └── generateResponse(prompt) : Future<String>
├── Claude4Model
│   └── generateResponse(prompt) : Future<String>
└── LocalLlamaModel
    └── generateResponse(prompt) : Future<String>
```

### Core Components

1. **Abstraction**: `AITask`
   - High-level interface for AI task processing
   - Contains reference to AIModel implementation
   - Defines common task execution workflow

2. **Refined Abstractions**: Specific task types
   - **QuestionAnsweringTask**: Handles Q&A processing with context
   - **SummarizationTask**: Processes text summarization with length control
   - **CodeGenerationTask**: Handles code generation with syntax formatting

3. **Implementation Interface**: `AIModel`
   - Low-level interface for AI model operations
   - Defines contract for generating responses
   - Platform-agnostic model interaction

4. **Concrete Implementations**: AI model implementations
   - **GPT4Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 model integration
   - **Claude4Model**: Anthropic Claude-4 model integration
   - **LocalLlamaModel**: Local LLaMA model implementation

### Key Features

#### **Independent Variation**
- **Task Types**: Add new task types without changing models
- **AI Models**: Add new models without changing task logic
- **Runtime Switching**: Change model implementation dynamically

#### **Specialized Processing**
- **Question Answering**: Context-aware response generation
- **Text Summarization**: Length-controlled content condensation
- **Code Generation**: Syntax-formatted programming assistance

#### **Multi-Model Support**
- **Cloud Models**: GPT-4, Claude-4 via API
- **Local Models**: LLaMA for offline processing
- **Unified Interface**: Same task code works with any model

### Usage Example

```dart
// Create different AI models
AIModel gpt4 = GPT4Model();
AIModel claude = Claude4Model();  
AIModel llama = LocalLlamaModel();

// Create task with GPT-4
AITask qaTask = QuestionAnsweringTask(gpt4);
String answer = await qaTask.run("What is machine learning?");

// Switch to Claude for same task type
qaTask = QuestionAnsweringTask(claude);
String answer2 = await qaTask.run("What is machine learning?");

// Different task with same model
AITask codeTask = CodeGenerationTask(claude);
String code = await codeTask.run("Create a Python function to sort a list");

// Switch model at runtime
AITask summaryTask = SummarizationTask(llama);
String summary = await summaryTask.run("Long text to summarize...");
```

## Benefits

### Advantages

1. **Independent Evolution**: Abstractions and implementations can change separately
2. **Runtime Flexibility**: Switch implementations dynamically
3. **Reduced Coupling**: Abstraction doesn't depend on concrete implementation
4. **Code Reusability**: Same task logic works with different models
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new tasks or models without affecting existing code

### Considerations

1. **Complexity**: Adds extra layer of abstraction
2. **Performance**: Indirect calls through bridge interface
3. **Design Overhead**: Requires careful interface design
4. **Initial Setup**: More complex than simple inheritance

## When to Use

### Use Bridge When:

- You want to avoid permanent binding between abstraction and implementation
- Both abstractions and implementations should be extensible through subclassing
- Changes in implementation shouldn't impact clients
- You need to switch implementations at runtime
- You want to share implementation among multiple objects

### Avoid Bridge When:

- You have only one implementation and it's unlikely to change
- The abstraction and implementation are tightly coupled by design
- Performance is critical and indirection overhead is unacceptable
- The system is simple and doesn't benefit from the flexibility

## Bridge vs Other Patterns

### **Bridge vs Adapter**
- **Bridge**: Designed upfront to let abstraction and implementation vary independently
- **Adapter**: Makes incompatible interfaces work together after the fact

### **Bridge vs Strategy**
- **Bridge**: Focuses on structural relationship between abstraction and implementation
- **Strategy**: Focuses on algorithm selection and substitution

### **Bridge vs State**
- **Bridge**: Implementation doesn't change behavior of abstraction
- **State**: Different states can completely change object behavior

## Real-World Applications

### 1. **Cross-Platform Development**
- **UI Frameworks**: Same UI code works on different platforms
- **Database Access**: Same query interface for different databases  
- **Graphics APIs**: Same rendering code for DirectX/OpenGL

### 2. **API Integration**
- **Payment Processing**: Same interface for PayPal, Stripe, Square
- **Cloud Services**: Same interface for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- **Analytics**: Same tracking code for different analytics providers

### 3. **Device Drivers**
- **Printers**: Same print interface for different printer types
- **Network Cards**: Same network interface for different hardware
- **Storage**: Same file operations for different storage types

### 4. **AI/ML Systems** (This Implementation)
- **Model Switching**: Same task logic with different AI models
- **Provider Independence**: Switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, local models
- **Task Flexibility**: Add new task types without changing model code

## Implementation Variations

### 1. **Simple Bridge** (This Implementation)
- One abstraction hierarchy, one implementation hierarchy
- Direct bridge between the two
- Most common and straightforward

### 2. **Multiple Bridges**
- Multiple abstraction hierarchies sharing implementations
- Complex but provides maximum flexibility
- Used in large, complex systems

### 3. **Refined Bridge**
- Additional layers between abstraction and implementation
- Provides more granular control
- Useful for complex domain requirements

## Design Principles Demonstrated

1. **Single Responsibility**: Abstractions handle high-level logic, implementations handle low-level details
2. **Open/Closed**: Open for extension (new tasks/models), closed for modification
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Abstractions depend on implementation interface, not concrete classes
4. **Composition over Inheritance**: Uses composition to bridge abstraction and implementation
